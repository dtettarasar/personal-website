      <p class="my-1 md:my-4">

        I started my career in <strong>digital communication and web project management</strong>, spending several years leading projects that connected strategy, 
        creativity, and technology.

      </p>

      <p class="my-1 md:my-4">

        During this time, I worked on <strong>WordPress websites, SEO optimization, and web content production</strong>, 
        often taking on both the strategic vision and the hands-on execution — from UX design to publishing and performance analysis.

      </p>

      <p class="my-1 md:my-4">

        This experience gave me a <strong>360° understanding of the web ecosystem</strong>: how a website is designed, developed, optimized, and maintained over time. 
        It also shaped my sense of autonomy, creativity, and adaptability — qualities that have always guided my work.

      </p>

      <p class="my-1 md:my-4">

        Over time, I felt the need to go deeper into the <strong>technical side of creation</strong>, to understand what happens under the hood — beyond CMS tools and pre-built solutions.
        That’s what led me to learn <strong>JavaScript, Python, and modern frameworks like Nuxt.js, Vue, and Django</strong>, and to gradually move towards <strong>fullstack development</strong>.
