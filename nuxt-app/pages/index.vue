       I started my career in digital communication and web project management, working across strategy, design, and execution. 
       For several years, <strong>I led and built WordPress websites, worked on SEO optimization, and handled UX, content creation, and performance analysis</strong>.

      </p>

      <p class="my-2 md:my-4">

        <strong>This gave me a full, practical understanding of how a website is conceived, designed, developed, delivered, and maintained</strong> — from both a technical and business perspective. 
        It also shaped my autonomy, creativity, and ability to bridge the gap between technical teams and user needs.

      <p class="my-2 md:my-4">

        But over time, <strong>I felt the need to go deeper</strong> — to move past CMS limitations and actually build things from the ground up. 
        That’s when I shifted toward development and started learning JavaScript, Python, and modern tools.

      </p>

      <p class="my-2 md:my-4">

        Today, I focus primarily on <strong>frontend development with Vue.js, Nuxt, and Tailwind CSS</strong>. 
        I enjoy crafting clean interfaces, smooth user experiences, and well-structured components, while keeping a flexible full-stack edge thanks to Node, Django, and database fundamentals.
