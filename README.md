# 🧭 Personal Website

**Overview**

This the source code of my personal website — a full-stack web application built with **Nuxt 3, MongoDB, and Docker**.
It is designed to showcase both my portfolio and technical skills, while remaining generic enough for anyone to use as a personal CV & portfolio website.

The project can be deployed as-is via Docker or used as a starting point to create a similar Nuxt.js-based application.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **MongoDB** — NoSQL database
- **Mongoose** *(optional)* — ODM to simplify MongoDB model and query management
- **Docker & Docker Compose** — Containerization and orchestration
- **Node.js 18+** — JavaScript runtime environment
